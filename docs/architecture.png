# Monitoring and Logging

This platform uses AWS CloudWatch for observability.

## Logging
- Lambda execution logs are stored in CloudWatch Logs
- API Gateway access logs record all incoming requests

## Metrics
- Number of invocations
- Execution duration
- Error rate
- Throttling events

## Troubleshooting
If the API fails:
1. Check API Gateway logs
2. Check Lambda logs in CloudWatch
3. Verify Docker image exists in ECR
